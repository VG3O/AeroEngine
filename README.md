# Aero Engine

### What is Aero?
Aero is a project currently in development that looks to create a video game engine for my own purposes and learning. Written in C++ and with scripting done in Lua.

### Current Implementations
- Written in C++ using raylib as a library. Originally was made in a college course.
- Component-based GameObject system
- Scripting capabilities using Lua
- Custom scripted components

### Tasks
- [ ] World-editor
- [ ] Implementing outside libraries for core game systems (PhysX, OpenGL, FMOD/Havok)
- [ ] Script-driven game [^1]
- [ ] Visual Studio IDE support [^2]
- [ ] Eventual switch to Luau [^3]

Feel free to shoot me suggestions on features that would be nice to have in an engine, as well as suggestions for bettering my code!
